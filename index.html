          Astaire started performing as a child, he partnered up with his older sister, Adele. The two toured the vaudeville circuit before making it to Broadway in 1917. For all of his early success, a career in the movies eluded Astaire. He managed to do a screen test, but failed to attract any attention or interest. One studio he tried out for wrote at the time, <strong>"Can't sing. Can't act. Slightly balding. Can dance a little."</strong> From the article <a href="https://www.biography.com/performer/fred-astaire"target="_blank">here.</a></p>
